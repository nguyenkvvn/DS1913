An AR-15 lower optimized for an Atchission/CMMG .22 LR conversion kit

Public Release v1.2

## Description
The DS1913 is an AR-15 lower, based off the Disruptive Solutions AR-15 lower from FOSSCAD, optimized for an Atchission/CMMG .22 LR conversion kit. Features to it include a 1913 rail on the rear for mounting compact braces or stocks, bolt-catch delete for added reinforcement, and integrated bolt-press-forward to increase reliability. The lower is refined specifically for 3D printing, accounting for shrinkage and tolerances (meaning your printer must be 100% calibrated), along with modifications needed to make the lower functional, as the original was published as untested.
